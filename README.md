### Hello, I'm Yuehao Shi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a graduate student pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), with a strong desire to excel as a Software Development Engineer. My skills encompass Java, C++, Python, SQL, Node.js, and React.js. I'm also equipped with a background in environmental engineering, which fuels my vision to digitize traditional engineering domains.

ðŸš€ Explore my portfolio at [yuehaoshi.github.io](https://yuehaoshi.github.io/) to see how I approach software design, debugging, deployment, and project management. My work reflects an innovative mindset and a commitment to customer satisfaction.

Driven by deadlines and undeterred by challenges, I'm eager to contribute my diverse skill set to a dynamic software development team. Let's connect and ignite innovation together!

Feel free to reach out to me via email at yuehaos2@illinois.edu for ideas, questions, or just to say hello. ðŸ˜„
